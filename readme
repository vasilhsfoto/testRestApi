++++3 tier application configured from scratch++++
1. Rest resources 
2. service layer
3. Dao layer
4. Mysql as data base

Technologies used:
-Tomcat deploys the web file descriptor (web.xml) for deploying the web app.

-Spring is used as DI framework && AOP

-Jboss Resteasy utilized for implementing JAX-RS WS.

-Integrating Resteasy + Spring so the applicationContext is loaded over the deployment process
each resource(end point) annotated with @Path is a Spring managed bean so autowired works
for resources as well. Important we don't have Resteasy create an instance for each resource
Resteasy requests instances that had been created by Spring IoC.

-Spring is used to take the singleton instance from DataSource. We currently use common DCP as connection
pool implementation (3rd party implementation)

-Dao implementation currently evaluated: 
1. plain JDBC for accessing Person Model object
2. JdbcTemplate for the same reason

--DataSource implementation used to be acquired by dbcp 3rd party connection pool implementation
  on 27/05/13 we changed it so the DataSource is implemented by Tomcat's connection pool implementation
  application using the DataSource via Spring. Spring implements look up mechanism and creates an Spring
  managed bean from JNDI service. Look at the applicationContext.xml configuration file.
