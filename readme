++++3 tier application configured from scratch++++
1. Rest resources 
2. Service layer
3. Dao layer
4. Mysql as data base

Technologies used:
-Tomcat servlet container is being used for deploying the application (WAR)

-Spring is used for Dependency Injection and AOP

-Jboss Resteasy utilized for implementing JAX-RS WS.

-Integrating Resteasy + Spring. Resteasy doesn't create an instance for each resource,
Rather Resteasy requests instances that had been created by Spring IoC. This way endpoints 
are spring managed beans and we can freely use them to inject other spring managed services.

-Dao implementation currently is based on: 
1. plain JDBC for accessing Person Model object
2. JdbcTemplate

-DataSource implementation used to be provided by dbcp 3rd party library. Now DataSource implementation
is provided by the container (Tomcat). Tomcat registers the DataSource using JNDI interface in 
an LDAP directory. We use Spring xml (<jee:jndi-lookup) for accessing the DataSource and getting a bean from it. The
configuration is inside ApplicationContext.xml file.
